## Why this MCP exists

LLMs frequently hallucinate ANZ public holiday dates. Common failure modes include:

- Citing the wrong date for floating holidays (e.g. King's Birthday varies by state)
- Conflating NZ and Australian holiday schedules
- Missing state-specific days (WA Day, Adelaide Cup, Canberra Day, Picnic Day, etc.)
- Applying incorrect Mondayisation rules
- Returning outdated Matariki dates

anz-schedule-brain eliminates these errors by providing a single authoritative
source of truth, verified against official government gazette publications.
